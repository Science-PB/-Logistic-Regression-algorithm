Image recognition with Logistic Regression algorithm


# Introduction
Linear models are a class of models that are widely used in practice and have been the subject of detailed study over the past few decades, and their history goes back to over a hundred years. Linear models are also widely used in classification problems. Let's look at the binary classification. In this case, the forecast is obtained using the following formula:



To get the result, we set the value to exactly zero for the predicted value. If the result is less than zero, then the value is -1, respectively, if the result is greater than 0, then the value is +1.

# Logistic Regression method

Overview: For this project, we will be using Logistic Regression to predict the image. To do
this, we will build 10 different models and use the softmax function to calculate the correct results after calculating the probabilities.

Data: The dataset consists of 784 features columns and 1 target column.(Figure 2). Target refers to numbering from 0 to 9 and applies to different clothes.(Figure 1).
